						<p>Instagram is an <strong>app based photo sharing program</strong> that was launched in October of 2010. It allows users 
                        to <strong>upload their pictures</strong>, whether taken with a mobile phone or a camera, onto an online 
                        <strong>personal profile page,</strong> 
                        then <strong>share those photos publically.</strong> What is unique about this app, which is now available on both iOS and Android, is that it offers 
                        users a variety of options to customize and edit their photos. <strong>Filters</strong> are the main focus of this app 
                        and when activated, alter the look and feel of the picture. <strong>Blur effects</strong> are another 
                        built-in feature of Instagram that can be used to create a <strong>focal point</strong> on any specific part of an uploaded photo. 
                        The popularity of this app has grown <strong>exponentially</strong> since its launch, reaching up to 100
                        million users in September earlier this year. Instagram has now extended from being solely accessible on mobile phones 
                        to being available on the Internet, where users now have their own <strong>public Instagram profile page</strong> just like other social 
                        networking sites such as <a href="www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="www.twitter.com">Twitter.</a></p>
