                        <h2>Step 1 - Getting The Right Angle</h2>
                        <p>Whether you are taking a close up shot of an <strong>object/person,</strong> or taking a wide angle shot of a 
                        <strong>nature scene,</strong>
                        using the right angle is key to a great Instagram photo. Before you snap a picture, make sure the 
                        camera on your mobile device is <strong>perfectly square</strong> and at a 90 degree angle 
                        as it will affect how you edit the picture later. Also,don't forget to <strong>turn the flash feature to on, off or 
                        auto</strong> depending on the lighting situation that you are in. Finally, during this first stage, you can turn the 
                        picture by touching the arrow in the top pane of the app.</p>
                        
                       
                        
                        <h2>Step 2 - Picking A Filter</h2>
                        <p>Some argue that the use of filters on Instagram is dumbing down photography. However, many pictures can 
                        appear <strong>more professional and sriking</strong> if properly edited using an Instagram filter. For the best effect,
                        <strong>multiple filters</strong> are sometimes used by taking a screenshot of a filtered image, reloading that image, then adding 
                        another layer of filters on top. There are currently a total of <strong>18 filters</strong> to choose from, 
                        all of which have a special effect (in order):

                        <h2>Step 3 - Picking A Border</h2>
                        <p>Some of the filters above offer a border option which when activated, surrounds the photo being edited with a 
                        pre-made border. Sometimes a border will enhance the original photo, other times it won't. It will be up to you 
                        to decide if you want to activate the border.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Step 4 - Blur Effects</h2>
                        <p>Similar to borders, blur effects are not always necessary when enhancing a photo, however, they can be very useful 
                        if the user wants to emphasize a specific part of their Instagram photo. Blur effects can be used to add depth to 
                        a photo or cover up an aspect of the image that the user may not have wanted to be seen. Two different blur shapes
                        are avaible, which are parallel sections or a circular section. After choosing the blur effect, you are ready to upload
                         your picture!</p>
