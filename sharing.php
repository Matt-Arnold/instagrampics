						<p>Editing and uploading your photos is just the first part of using Instagram. <strong>Getting others to see those photos</strong> is another
                        important step. 
                        Many different approaches are taken when it comes to <strong>gaining likes and follows</strong> on Instagram.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>One strategy is to use <strong>hashtags.</strong> Although hashtags were first made popular on Twitter,
                        they are vital to maximizing the reach of your Instagram photos.
                        This doesn't mean use just any hashtags but rather, include the most popular hashtags in the <strong>caption</strong> so your photos will 
                        appear to a larger audience. Some of the most popular Instagram hashtags right now include <strong>#love, #instagood, 
                        #photooftheday, #iphonesia and #tweegram.</strong> To keep up with the hottest IG hashtags, visit
                        <a href="http://web.stagram.com/hot/">Webstagram.</a>
                        
                        <p>Another strategy is to <strong>like the pictures of other Instagram users and give them a follow</strong> so that you show up in their news feed. 
                        If you like someone's picture or follow follow them, they will most likely check out your profile and scroll through your 
                        Instagram picture feed simply out of curiosity. By continuing to <strong>target active Instagram users</strong> by 
                        liking their pictures or following them, you have the potential to <strong>build up a large army of loyal
                        IG followers.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Finally, don't forget to share the photos you post on Instagram to <strong>other social media sites.</strong> Underneath the 
                        captions and Photo Map area in the "Share Photo" menu on Instagram, there is a <strong>"Share" area</strong> that can link
                        to your <strong>Facebook, Twitter, email, Tubmlr, Flickr or foursquare.</strong> You can share your newest 
                        photos simultaneously on all of these social media outlets simply by connecting your 
                        Instagram account to each outlet and selecting the ones you want to have your picture posted to.</p>
